    # These properties will be included in specific Tasked steps; therefore
    # their getters will be called from that context and so must call up to
    # the "task_step" to access data in the TaskStep "base" class.
    #
    # Using included properties instead of decorator inheritance makes it easier
    # to render and parse json -- there is no confusion about which level to use
    # it is always just the Tasked level and properties that access "base" class
    # values always reach up to it.
